# DemoCrud

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 7.3.4.

## Node Modules

Run `npm install` before to start.

## Explanation of the project

Reqres does not store any of the data at all. Once you send data, Reqres just send it straight back...and then it is gone!

Because of that, I put the responses of the API's requests in modals. You cannot see new or deleted users in the UI. You only can see the existing data (list of contacts and details of each one) in Reqres (REST API mockup).

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
