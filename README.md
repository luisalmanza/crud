# DemoCrud

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 7.3.4.

## Node Modules

Run `npm install` before to start.

## Explanation of the project

Reqres doesn't store any of the data at all. Once you send data, Reqres just send it straight back...and then it's gone!

Because of that, I put the responses of the requests in the logs (console). You can't see new or deleted users in the UI. You only can see the existing data (list of contacts and details of each one).

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
